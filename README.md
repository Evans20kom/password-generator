## Description

A simple password manager application using html, css, and javascript, that takes user input and generates a pseudo-random string of characters that the end user can use as a password.

# *** EDIT BEFORE SUBMITTING ***
This application aims to emulate a real world application that receives input in the format of a 2-dimensional array and produces output that is meaningful to the end user (e.g. numerical data and information)

I engaged with this project as it was an opportunity to identify ways to mathematically manipulate array data and present them in a functional way for the end user.

While building this application, I have learnt about two-dimensional arrays and how to call on information from them, how javascript processes mathematical functions, and how to troubleshoot when the application does not behave as expected, by changing elements to identify which part of the application is responsible for the unpredictable output.

<li>CG Collin - Central Grader: After grading the challenge for week 4, they confirmed that the corrections I made to the README file were acceptable; based on this feedback, I maintained the previous REAME file structure as a template for future projects.</li>
